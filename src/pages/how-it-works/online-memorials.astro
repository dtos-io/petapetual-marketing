            <p>
                The online memorial is the core of the <Petapetual /> experience.
                More than just a static website for your loved ones, it's your own
                portable, accessible monument to those that have passed away. Never
                feel too far away from them again.

                Access your memorial from any device, anywhere in the world,
                anytime you want. No need to travel to the cemetery, no need to
                wait for columbarium opening times, no app installation
                required. Mobile, tablet, desktop, we've got you covered.

                Memorials have access to offerings such as <a

                Include your friends and family and bring warmth to your
                memorials. Once your memorial is set up, invite other <Petapetual
                /> users to view it, write loving messages in the guestbook, and
                place their own tributes to honor the deceased.

            <p>
                Your memorials are not publicly accessible unless you want them
                to be. Pay your respects in private, or with a select group of
                close individuals that you have invited.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you opt-in for a public memorial, anyone can view your
                memorial without an account. They will not be able to post in
                the guestbook, nor will they be able toplace tributes.
