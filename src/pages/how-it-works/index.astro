            <p>
                A memorial is a single page you create for your late loved one.
                They are the bread and butter of the <Petapetual /> experience and
                most of the value of our platform unlocks after you have created
                one. You can create multiple memorials depending on the plan you
                have purchased.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will be able to upload a photo and populate details such as
                their name, date of birth, date of passing, and even a short
                epitaph to display.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also invite other users of <Petapetual /> to your memorial
                to view it and leave a loving message in the guestbook.
            </p>

                All memorials created under a paid plan can subscribe to a <a

            <p>
                Memorials can be subscribed to <i>prayer streams</i>, which are
                powerful automated virtual prayer sessions that happen 24/7.
                When subscribed, you are guaranteed that your memorial will
                receive the prayers and blessings of your choice constantly
                every day. You may choose from a variety of prayers across
                different cultures and religions, or simply choose not to
                subscribe to a prayer stream.

            <p>
                <i>Tributes</i> are additional adornments and blessings you may add
                to your memorials to pay your respects. They have different purposes
                and effects, ranging from being purely decorative to having an actual
                service or action tied to them when they are used.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other users you invite to your memorials will be able to place
                tributes as well.
