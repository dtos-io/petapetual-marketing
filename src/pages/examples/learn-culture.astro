        <Petapetual /> for those disconnected from their culture
    </h1>

    <p>
        As the world becomes more and more modern, many traditional rites and
        practices are slowly being forgotten. If you are someone who wants to
        honor the dearly departed in line with tradition, it can be confusing
        and difficult to know what to do, what prayers to say, and what
        offerings to give (if at all).
    </p>

    <p>
        <Petapetual /> aims to assist you in this aspect. We believe that, <a
            href="/how-it-works"
            class="blueLink">amongst other services we provide</a
        >, an online memorial with us is also an opportunity for education. We
        aim to provide you with information, services, and useful reminders that
        are aligned with the traditions you want to observe.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Memorial cultural preferences</h2>

    <p>
        By default, all <Petapetual />
        <a class="blueLink" href="/how-it-works/online-memorials">memorials</a> are
        culturally and religiously agnostic: we do not make any assumptions or opinionated
        choices as to what and how things should be done. However, if you so choose
        to, you can set a <i>cultural preference</i> for your memorial, which will
        tell us which traditions you want your memorial to subscribe to.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if you set a memorial's cultural preference to <i
            >Buddhist</i
        >, then we will suggest and bias your memorial towards more Buddhist <a
            class="blueLink"
            href="/how-it-works/tributes">tributes</a
        > and <a class="blueLink" href="/how-it-works/prayer-streams"
            >prayer streams</a
        >.
    </p>

    <p>
        Setting your memorial's cultural preference does not lock you in to any
        one tradition. It only affects service suggestions and special date
        reminders. You can change this setting at any time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Special date reminders</h2>

    <p>
        Your memorials have the ability to send you reminders or information
        about special dates, these include dates such as death anniversaries,
        birthdays, religious festivals, etc.
