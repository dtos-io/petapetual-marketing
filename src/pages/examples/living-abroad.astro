        Once set up, a <Petapetual /> memorial is always accessible to you, no matter
        where in the world you are. Across mobile, tablet, and desktop- no app installations
        required. Simply sign in whenever you want to, or whenever you miss the dearly
        departed and visit their <a
            href="/how-it-works/online-memorials"
            class="underline text-blue-600">virtual memorial</a
        >.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Invite others to your memorial</h2>

    <p>
        You don't have to pay your respects alone: invite other people to your
        memorials so you can all remember your late loved ones together: write
        loving messages in the guestbook, place <a
            href="/how-it-works/tributes"
            class="underline text-blue-600">tributes</a
        >, and reminisce with one another across oceans and time zones.
