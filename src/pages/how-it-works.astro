            <p>
                A memorial is a single page you create for your late loved one.
                You can create multiple memorials depending on the plan you have
                purchased.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will be able to upload a photo and populate details such as
                their name, date of birth, date of passing, and even a short
                epitaph to display.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also invite other users of Petapetual to your memorial
                to view it and leave a loving message in the guestbook.
            </p>

            <p>
                All memorials created under a paid plan can subscribe to a <a
                    class="underline text-blue-600"
                    href="#prayer-streams">prayer stream</a
                > in order to receive prayers 24/7.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold" id="prayer-streams">
                Prayer Streams <LinkToTop />
            </h2>

            <p>
                Memorials can be subscribed to <i>prayer streams</i>, which are
                automated virtual prayer sessions that happen 24/7. When
                subscribed, you are guaranteed that your memorial will receive
                your prayers and blessings every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may choose from a variety of prayers across different
                cultures and religions, set your own custom prayer, or simply
                choose not to subscribe to a prayer stream.

            </h2>

            <p>
                <i>Tributes</i> are additional adornments and blessings you may add
                to your memorials to pay your respects. They have different purposes
                and effects, from being purely decorative to having an actual service
                or action tied to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other users you invite to your memorials will be able to place
                tributes as well.
